title: Discogs Explorer

Discogs has all the data, and a less-optimal way of browing it, to say the least. So in 2019 we, Internet4000, decided to make an alternate front-end for it. There was a proxy API that cached everything and made it pretty fast. Unfortunately no longer online, APIs change, so do we.
