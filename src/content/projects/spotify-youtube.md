title: Spotify to YouTube to Radio4000
---

When you enjoy a piece of music, you want to share it and play it anywhere. Being locked into a specific platform prevents this.

So I made a tool that allows you to kind of bridge the gap between the three music platforms I use: Radio4000, YouTube and Spotify.

Give it a Spotify playlist and it'll generate a YouTube playlist with the same songs. Import this list into your Radio4000, or export the track titles as text, csv or whichever format you prefer.
