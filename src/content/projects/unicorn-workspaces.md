In 2019 I joined Unicorn as their CTO. It was also my first job in a company with more than three employees. Great place to work, lovely people, learned a lot. Still helping them from the outside, and my office is in the Village space in Berlin. 

Although public here's a [private post from 2021 about it](https://www.unicorn.de/media/uploads/unicornworkspaces-blog-durchdentagmit-oskar-en.jpg).
