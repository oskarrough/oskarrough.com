Hej. Most people know it already. Some even do it. Now I want to, too. Again.

Writing is good for you. It helps you clear your thoughts, you can share what your passions and pains with others. For too long the trend has been switching towards bulletlists and <140 characters of infinite wisdom. No more, the words must return.

There's also something about publishing on your own domain, compared to posting on whatever. Platforms come and go, this is my space.

It is time to take time. Anyone can generate knowledge, but not everyone is able to take time.

You can not comment here, this is not the space. Make your own space.
