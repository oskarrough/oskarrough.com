Hey. Most know it already, some do it, some don't. Now I want to. Again.

Writing is good for you. It helps you clear your thoughts, you can share what you're passionate about with others. For too long the trend has been switching towards bulletlists and <140 characters of infinite wisdom. No more, the blog must return.

There's also something about publishing on your own domain, compared to posting on _insert social platform here_.

It is time to take time. Anyone can <s>write</s>generate a 1000 word article in 5 seconds using _insert AI thing_.

Hey a side thought. How do people then reply to what is shared here? I do not want to host comments.
