For another idea I needed a drawer UI like you know from mobile UI.

If you're using React, [Vaul](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/building-a-drawer-component) seems good. But I'm not using React.

I prototyped a new custom element: `<rough-drawer>`, but quickly learned that this pattern is commonly called a "sheet". And since all my web components are prefixed with my last name... welcome <rough-sheet> - your new drawer sheet ui element.

It's not done, but try dragging on https://sheet.0sk.ar/ and [view source](https://github.com/oskarrough/rough-sheet).
