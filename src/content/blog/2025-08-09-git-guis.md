I've been using git via the terminal since many years and I'm quite comfortable in that workflow using `git add -p`. HOWEVER, once in a while having a GUI to quickly get an overview of the diff really helps. When that is, Sublime Merge is my prefered tool. It's cross-platform, it's not an editor. It just works. 

Except if you're using WSL and try to install it on Windows. Don't do that. TIL you can install it directly inside Ubuntu (WSL) and use wslg to launch.
