We've had the copy/pasting era of the LLMs, we have AI assistants inside our editors and now we also have them as CLI programs. Having them side-by-side with your local files and letting it loose is a sight to behold. The UI is interesting, too. Slash commands, auto-complete and a text input with many shortcuts, vim-bindings and so on. Pretty fun way to interact with your files.

[`claude`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) just works really well.

[`gemini`](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (Google's AI) released their CLI tool and made it open source. It was interesting to read their [system prompt]( https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/packages/core/src/core/prompts.ts).
