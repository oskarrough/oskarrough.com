# What I'm doing now

## June 2025

Enjoying summer. Thinking about malleable software and trying to think less about AI.

## February 2025

Same as January. But also baked more bread. And helping prepare NK Flohmarkt + moving Touch Me project into phase two. Greetings from my BÃ¼ro in Berlin.

## January 2025

Helping Flere Fugle with their identity and websites. Continuing the Touch Me project, more Unicorn Workspaces. Still making more web games, which is very fun. Drawing Moebius things.

# April 2024

Left the Unicorn team and went back to freelance. This was in October 2023, today it is mid April 2024. There are exciting and enough projects, business things and love and AI. If you are around Richardstr. please come by.
