/**
 * Icons
 */


// Compass can generate a sprite .png image from a folder of icons. The name of the folder is used in all Compass variables and functions related to this sprite image. In our example, the folder is in /images/icon which means our vars are always prefixed with $icon-. This is a Compass convention.


/**
 * If you want more spacing between the icons, use this
 */

// $icon-spacing: 30px;


/**
 * If you want Compass to write width and height properties in every sprite class, use this
 */

$icon-sprite-dimensions: true;


/**
 * If a sprite should be aligned to the right, use this. Remember to change the nameofmyicon.
 */

//$icon-nameofmyicon-position: 100%;


/**
 * After all the settings, we import the Compass files related to sprites
 */

@import 'compass/utilities/sprites';


/**
 * Import all icons. Path is relative to your image folder which is defined in either config.rb or Gruntfile.js

/**
 * If you want to get the height or width of a sprite, use this
