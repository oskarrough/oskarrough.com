<p>Hello, I'm Oskar Rough Mosumgaard.</p>

<p>I intend to invent creative platforms to support the next century. I was born in 1988 in north western Denmark, Thy. In 2010 I moved to Berlin, Germany where I’m living today with my wife.</p>

<p>I like music, food, sun, design and technology. Perhaps more interesting, me and others share our passion for music on <a href="http://radio4000.com">Radio4000</a> — also: <a href="https://mixcloud.com/oskar" target="_blank">Mixcloud</a></p>
<p>Contact me at <a href="mailto:oskar@rough.dk">oskar@rough.dk</a>.</p>
