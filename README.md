This is the code for my website at https://oskarrough.com.

Pages in `src/pages` are usually rendered using the `src/components/Layout.astro` component.

We have two `content collections` in `src/content`: blog and projects, as defined in `src/content.config.js`.

Most styles are global and defined in `src/styles/global.css`.
